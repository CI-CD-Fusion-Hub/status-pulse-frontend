# CI-CD-Fusion-Hub - Vue 3 + Vite Application

CI-CD-Fusion-Hub is a Vue 3 application built with Vite that serves as a platform for connecting and managing multiple CI/CD platforms, including GitLab, GitHub, and Jenkins. This application empowers users to view and manage pipelines within a unified interface. Users can initiate, halt, and control pipelines, and administrators can enforce access restrictions to determine which users can access specific pipelines.

CI-CD-Fusion-Hub offers cost-saving benefits by streamlining CI/CD pipeline management. For example, GitLab Enterprise users can reduce their costs per user by utilizing this application's efficient pipeline control and access management features.

This README file provides detailed information about the project, including how to set it up and run it, project structure, available scripts, dependencies, and how to contribute to the development of the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) - This should come with Node.js installation.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fusion-hub

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

### Development
To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

This will launch the application in development mode with hot-reloading at http://localhost:3000.


### Building for Production
To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
The production-ready build will be located in the dist directory.

### Preview Production Build
To preview the production build, use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```
This will serve the production build for previewing.

## Environment Configuration

By following these steps, you can configure the backend URL for your application. Make sure not to share sensitive information in your `.env` file, and keep it secure.

1. Duplicate the `.env-template` file in the project root directory.

2. Rename the duplicated file to `.env`.

3. Open the `.env` file and set the `VITE_backendUrl` variable to your actual backend API URL. For example: `VITE_backendUrl=https://localhost:8111/api/v1`
